# Home Automation Project

## Summary
  In this project, I created a server to control all automated tasks inside my home, including the shared services of my home such as Network-Attached Storage and the Media Server. I used a small form factor Lenovo Thinkcentre and installed a Proxmox hypervisor on it. I then installed multiple Virtual Machines to serve as each of the functions described above. 

## Purpose

  This is a project that is ongoing in my household. I have been constantly building and re-building the home server for nearly 15 years by this point. I have had it on a large ATX box, a Raspberry Pi, and a Mac Mini. This iteration is easier in design but more complex in implementation. However, this version of the home server will add on new features.

   ### Existing Feature List
   - Media Server
   - Media Storage

   ### New Features
   - Home Automation Hub to control IoT devices and provide reports 
   - Network Attached Storage that is RAID ready for further expansion
   - UniFi controller software to control the Ubiquiti network devices present without utilizing the cloud
   - Personal VPN for use when family members are mobile
